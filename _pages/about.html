        <h6 class="double-u">Background</h6>
        <p>Missy is a nationally certified and state licensed Occupational Therapist, Driving Rehab Specialist, and Driving Instructor.</p>
        <p>With over 25 years of experience working with diverse populations across the lifespan, most of her focus has been on supporting and empowering persons/families dealing with invisible differences. Her primary goal is helping those who are underserved by healthcare and educational system limitations.</p>
        <p>Missy's OT Driving Rehabilitation experience began in 2001 at North Kansas City Hospital. There she completed clinical evaluation and potential to drive assessments with adults due to age-related or disability factors including Stroke, Dementia, Alzheimer’s, Brain Injury, and Orthopedic challenges.</p>
        <p>In 2002, Missy began pediatric practice emphasis. She opened a specialty pediatric OT clinic with educational support services in 2013. At that time, she created a driving readiness therapy program for teens. </p>
