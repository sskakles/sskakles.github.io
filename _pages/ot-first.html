    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      OT-FIRST methodology aims to provide structure and guidance. It offers a collection of existing field data, OT models/frameworks, and tools for therapists to know, learn or reference back to when addressing a younger driver or community mobility need. This is important not only for consistency in approach and language but also to honor the beneficial work of others. OT-FIRST then goes beyond what is currently in existence. It offers new and completely functional driving & community mobility “readiness” (or safety-related) screenings, assessments, and treatment strategies which can help treating clinicians across OT settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the OT-FIRST clinical observations measure called “OT-FIRST COM”, several supplementary screeners are also included. As mentioned, the OT-FIRST (OTF) framework is intended to cover all bases and serve a variety of clients and clinician needs. Therapists are encouraged to use the aspects of the method and tools which work for them and to use advanced professional and clinical reasoning to support next steps in treatment planning, recommendations and referral.
