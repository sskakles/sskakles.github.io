    <p>For the past decade, I have referred my clients to St. David's Adaptive Driving Program, and in 2019, I was hired to join their team as an active employee.

      <p>St. David's Rehabilitation Hospital Adaptive Driving Program is the only one of its kind in Central Texas. Because driving is an essential part of maintaining independence, the program promotes self-reliance through medically-based driver evaluation and training. A registered occupational therapist with extensive driver rehabilitation experience and training will provide a comprehensive assessment and recommendations. If you would like to speak with me about getting started through St. David's, you can email me at <a href="mailto:melissa.bell@stdavids.com">melissa.bell@stdavids.com</a>. My St. David's driving rehabilitation hours are select weekdays between 8am-5pm.

      <p>St. David's does <u><i>not</i></u> presently offer mobile OT driving rehabilitation services and only operates Mon-Fri, 8am-5pm during <i>"non-inclement"</i> weather. Clients who require extended service needs (i.e., weekends, weekdays before 8am or after 5pm, driving during <i>"inclement"</i> weather) can work with me privately through Safe Driving Rehab, LLC.</p>

      <p>For questions about these private services, please email me at <a href="mailto:missy@safedrivingrehab.com">missy@safedrivingrehab.com</a> or call my mobile number at 512-689-0236.</p>
