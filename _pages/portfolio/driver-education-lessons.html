    <p>For anyone seeking assistance in learning to drive, including <i>adults</i> and those <i>already licensed</i>, I can teach you using my adapted vehicle as a <a href="https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/DESSearch/results/getvalidation?searchterm=melissa+bell">Texas Licensed Driver Education Instructor</a>.</p>

    <p>I have worked with diverse clients in terms of age span, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, physical abilities and disabilities, and various driving experiences. Since I am not a school, drivers education coursework and certificates can be obtained on your own through <a href="https://driversed.com">driversed.com</a> or <a href="https://www.aceable.com/">aceable.com</a>.</p>

    <p>TThe safest approach with conditions such as Autism, Anxiety, ADHD, SPD, visual and auditory processing differences, physical or cognitive-based driving challenges, and beyond is to work with a driving rehabilitation specialist such as myself rather than a standard Drivers-Ed School. I can collaborate with Austin Driving School or other instructors to ensure private lessons are approached in the safest manner.</p>

    <p>To screen your teen for Readiness or Fitness to Drive use the following tools: <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAAN2KIhJUN1NQMlJHTTFVSEowVThJTlhGRDhDVEo3Ui4u"><i>"Readiness-To-Drive-Safe (RTDS) Screener"</i></a> and
