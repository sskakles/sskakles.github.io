    <p>Changes in health over time and age itself can lead to questions about driving safety. Whether it be for yourself or a loved one, this can be a stressful topic especially because driving-related changes with age are different for everyone. It's important for a driving rehab specialist to help individuals transition into driving retirement or cessation when appropriate and medically necessary. If done appropriately, the screening and test results should point out what's the best most logical choice for everyone's safety and the therapist should help individuals stay mobile.</p><p> I have a service or referral relationships with providers who work with adults in a wide service area radius including Dallas, Waco, Georgetown, Austin, San Antonio, Houston and beyond. I can refer you to multiple mobile service providers or clinic and hospital-based programs if working with me is not an option.
