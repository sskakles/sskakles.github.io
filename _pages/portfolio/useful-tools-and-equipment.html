    <p>Sometimes for driving independence or to make driving the most safe, special tools are required. I can work with clients to learn to use some basic low-tech driving equipment and prescribe equipment needs to vendors for installation prior to fitting. For more complex equipment needs I can refer you to an additional specialist and vehicle modifier.</p>

	  <p>Here are some links to equipment videos that may suit your needs <a href="http://featherlite-hvl.com/gallery.html">Suregrip Featherlight Controls</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2afw6D6WgHA&t=0s&list=PLhyRxF0nypifW9CpKGYQigpylujMpTtNm&index=50">Veigel Classic II Controls</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7iN8GiI2Hw">Over-Ring Accelerator</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOo_0MhjldQ">Other Common Vehicle Adaptations</a>.</p> 
	  
<p>I can help elderly drivers be better positioned and set up for driving by completing a complementary CarFit screening or help a whole community of aging adults by helping host a volunteer event. </p>
    
<p>For parents who want to do in-car driving instruction, I can make safe choices regarding beneficial accessories and even suggest a variety of options for personal training brakes.
