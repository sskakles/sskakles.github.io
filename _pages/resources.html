        <h6 class="double-u">1. Who is a readiness screening for?</h6>

        <p>The readiness screening is for an adolescent or young adult who has a known medical issue, condition, or traits that could make driving an added challenge. The screening is used to begin pre-planning for the tasks of driving or community mobility.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">2. Who is a potential to drive assessment for? </h6>
        <p>The potential to drive assessment could be for a person seeking a permit/licensure who is uncertain about safe driving ability or who could be able to drive but with some restrictions for best safety. OT/DRS’s do this assessment and make safe driving recommendations to the primary care physician and family before proceeding to behind the wheel for training.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">3. Who is a comprehensive safe driving evaluation for? </h6>
        <p>This evaluation includes the pre-screening intake, clinical assessment and behind the wheel testing. It is for the permitted or licensed driver with safe driving limitations due to medical condition or other issue. If for a permitted student, this eval is to see if advancement to licensure without restrictions is appropriate (because passing a road test is not an indicator of being a safe driver in various situations). If for a licensed individual, who had a medical status change, the evaluation helps decide if the person is safe to drive again and if additional equipment or restrictions are needed. This is required for the referring doctor and state.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">4. What is an IDP? </h6>
        <p>An Individualized Driver Plan is like a school IEP or Occupational Therapy Treatment plan. Based on performance factors and client goals, a driving plan is created for a person in need. It has recommended activities, frequency, and duration. A progress check occurs as needed to update the plan.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">5. What ages and conditions do you serve? </h6>
        <p>I serve teenagers, adults and elderly with a variety of needs. If I do not feel qualified or comfortable in addressing a specific issue for some reason, have a waitlist, do not take the preferred payor, or cannot travel as far or often as needed, then I will refer to someone else for assistance. I have referral relationships with multiple providers in the State and we all specialize in distinct areas of practice.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">6. What locations of central Texas do you serve? </h6>
        <p>My territory is primarily the Austin Metro Area which is about 30-90 min in any direction of downtown (depending on traffic) but I can make special trips to serve outlying communities and additional cities. Travel to and from appointments taking more than 20-30 min will cost a little extra for drive time and milage. 

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">7. What are your hours? </h6>
        <p>All services are by appointment. Medically-based driver rehabilitation needs always take precedence over regular driver lesson students. 

<h6 class="double-u">8. Where are services located?</h6>
<p>Since I am a fully mobile provider, all service locations are pre-arranged to be in a safe and convenient place. Typically, screenings or assessments and conferences are done in quiet location such as a residence, school, library, lodge, church, clinic, hospital, or program facility. I do driving lessons around the general living area of the driver’s home and in regions the student would need to drive. Sometimes phone calls and face-to-face computerized meetings are offered for added convenience if appropriate. If desired, a private conference space can also be rented.
            </p>
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">9. What is required to participate? </h6>
        <p>In order to do any behind-the-wheel testing or training, a Texas driving permit or legal license is required. It cannot be expired, revoked or suspended. All clients must complete an intake process and have a pre-approved method of payment. Partial payment could be taken up front for any scheduled service. For any services being documented and billed as Occupational Therapy, a doctor script and plan of care is required. Particpants must follow all recommendations for safety and be able to attend regular training sessions until discharge. 

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">10. Are you a licensed school? </h6>
        <p>Not presently, but I have worked for a regular driving school and currently work for a TEA licensed special education and rehabilitation driving program.  My OT driving rehab services and private safe driver coaching (or parent-taught lesson assistance) can count towards GDL requirements. I will discuss which route of driver training is most appropriate for students with medical conditions after an OT driver assessment and/or creation of an Individualized Driving Plan (IDP).

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">11. What is the cost of services? </h6>
        <p>Price of regular lessons is competitive at around $60/hour. OT driver evaluation and training can be somewhat variable but breaks down to an hourly rate typical for the average Occupational Therapy/Driving Rehab Specialist. We have major expenses to cover so most services will be in the $100-150/hour range. Some providers charge $200 or more per hour. I try to make all of my services fair and accessible to anyone in need and would be happy to discuss rate of service quotes privately. The “cost” of not getting services could be much more if an accident occurs. Additional costs may include travel time or gas milage and non-direct services. 

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">12. How long are driving evaluations and training? </h6>
        <p>Time varies based on client factors but on average, a full and comprehensive evaluation lasts around 4 hours and training is generally 1-2 hours. Clinical assessments are around 2 hours and screenings are about an hour of direct intervention after doing pre-screenings ahead of time. Conference time is as long as needed. Private lessons are generally 1-2 hours in duration. 

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">13. Will insurance cover this? Why not? And Why Are Services Becoming Private Pay Only? </h6>
        <p>Most insurance does not cover driving rehab as "driving" is considered an Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL). Medicare also does not consider driving a medical necessity and therefore services for it are not medically necessary (although we all disagree!). For this reason, more and more driving rehab providers are not accepting insurance and going the private pay route to reduce out-of-pocket costs for clients.  In my own past experience with attempting to take and file insurance, there were numerous times where services appeared covered and were then denied. Unfortunately, some former patients refused to pay or could not afford the bill so I had to have collections take over and take losses.  As a small business, this simply does not work. There are other reasons for my decision to be cash-based. Insurance companies and assisting payors can delay and limit needed services. Just recently I was told by TWC to proceed with an OT evaluation as it was "approved" and then it apparently wasn't (but neither myself or the client were told). I was not paid but decided to do the right thing and not to bill the client. In order to avert the usual payer problems, all Safe Driving Rehab services are private pay. My rates are the lowest available in the area.  I accept cash, credit/debit/flex spending cards, or electronic transfers of funds (Paypal, Venmo) on the day of service. Clients can try to submit for reimbursement on their own. 

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">14. Do you only address driving? </h6>
        <p>No. I also address community mobility, safety, independence in living, health/and well-being. These can be direct services or supportive consultation services.
