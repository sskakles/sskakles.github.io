        <h1 class="double-u-2">FAQ</h1>
        <h6 class="double-u">1. Who is a readiness screening for?</h6>

        <p>The readiness screening is for an adolescent or young adult who has a known medical issue, condition, or traits that could make driving an added challenge. The screening is used to begin pre-planning for the tasks of driving or community mobility.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">2. Who is a potential to drive assessment for? </h6>
        <p>The potential to drive assessment could be for a person seeking a permit/licensure who is uncertain about safe driving ability or who could be able to drive but with some restrictions for best safety. OT/DRS’s do this assessment and make safe driving recommendations to the primary care physician and family before proceeding to behind the wheel for training.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">3. Who is a comprehensive safe driving evaluation for? </h6>
        <p>This evaluation includes the pre-screening intake, clinical assessment and behind the wheel testing. It is for the permitted or licensed driver with safe driving limitations due to medical condition or other issue. If for a permitted student, this eval is to see if advancement to licensure without restrictions is appropriate (because passing a road test is not an indicator of being a safe driver in various situations). If for a licensed individual, who had a medical status change, the evaluation helps decide if the person is safe to drive again and if additional equipment or restrictions are needed. This is required for the referring doctor and state.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">4. What is an IDP? </h6>
        <p>An Individualized Driver Plan is like a school IEP or Occupational Therapy Treatment plan. Based on performance factors and client goals, a driving plan is created for a person in need. It has recommended activities, frequency, and duration. A progress check occurs as needed to update the plan.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">5. What ages and conditions do you serve? </h6>
        <p>I serve teenagers, adults and elderly with a variety of needs. If I do not feel qualified or comfortable in addressing a specific issue for some reason, have a waitlist, do not take the preferred payor, or cannot travel as far or often as needed, then I will refer to someone else for assistance. I have referral relationships with multiple providers in the State and we all specialize in distinct areas of practice.
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">6. What locations of central Texas do you serve? </h6>
        <p>My territory is primarily the Austin Metro Area which is about 30 min to an hour in any direction of downtown (depending on traffic) but I can make special trips to serve outlying communities and additional cities.

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">7. What are your hours? </h6>
        <p>All services are by appointment, but mostly M-F during normal daytime hours except holidays and during travel.

<h6 class="double-u">8. Where are services located?</h6>
<p>Since I am a fully mobile provider, all service locations are pre-arranged to be in a safe and convenient place. Typically, screenings or assessments and conferences are done in quiet location such as a school, library, lodge, church, clinic, hospital, or residential program facility. I do driving lessons around the general living area of the driver’s home. Sometimes phone calls and face-to-face computerized meetings are offered for added convenience if appropriate. If desired, a private conference space can also be rented.
            </p>
        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">9. What is required to participate? </h6>
        <p>In order to do any behind-the-wheel testing or training, a Texas driving permit or legal license is required. It cannot be expired. All clients must complete an intake process and have a pre-approved method of payment. Partial payment is taken up front for any scheduled service.

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">10. Are you a licensed school? </h6>
        <p>Not presently, but I work for a regular driving school and will be partnering with another provider for the purpose of addressing medical needs or other differences for credit towards GDL. We can discuss if either of those routes may be appropriate for your needs after assessment and creation of an Individualized Driving Plan (IDP).

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">11. What is the cost of services? </h6>
        <p>Price of evaluation and training can be somewhat variable but breaks down to an hourly rate typical for the average Occupational Therapy/Driving Rehab Specialist. We have major expenses to cover so most services will be in the $100-150/hour range. I try to make services fair and accessible to anyone in need and would be happy to discuss rate of service quotes privately. The “cost” of not getting services could be much more if an accident occurs.

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">12. How long are driving evaluations and training? </h6>
        <p>Time varies based on client factors but on average, a full and comprehensive evaluation lasts around 4 hours and training is generally 1-2 hours. Clinical assessments are around 2 hours and screenings are about an hour of direct intervention after doing pre-screenings ahead of time. Conference time is as long as needed.

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">13. Will insurance cover this? </h6>
        <p>Most insurance does not cover driving as it is considered an Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL). All services are private pay. Clients can try to submit for reimbursement on their own. In some cases, another payer may assist such as worker’s compensation, VA or specialty organization funding, but pre-approval of such is required.

        </p>
        <h6 class="double-u">14. Do you only address driving? </h6>
        <p>No. I also address community mobility, safety, independence in living, health/and well-being. These can be direct services or supportive consultation services.
