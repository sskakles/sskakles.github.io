Abstract
Background. This report is based on a case of ‘shaken baby syndrome,’ and clinical manifestations of this injury often include hypertonicity, spasticity and joint contracture. Shaken baby syndrome affects over 1 million children and resembles symptoms of traumatic brain injury.

Over the course of treatment, multiple modalities were used to manage his tone, spasticity and to reduce wrist and elbow contractures, which included Botoxw (Allergan Co., Irvine, CA, USA), manual therapy and dynamic splinting as home therapy.
