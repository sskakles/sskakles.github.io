  comment: After losing the use of my right foot, therefore, my ability to drive, I was devastated. Thankfully, I located Melissa’s services online. She came to my home completely prepared to help me achieve my full driving potential. I was able to try three different hand controls, settling on the one I was most comfortable with. Her compassionate and understanding manner were so helpful in reaching my driving goals. She has followed through with referrals and advice up to, and including, acquiring my driver’s license.

  comment: Just the mention of "driver evaluation" for an older/aging adult can be a traumatic experience. Missy is excellent at her profession. With her excellent people skills, She can take a traumatic situation and turn it into comfortable positive experience. I highly recommend her.

  comment: I just can't thank Missy enough. It's amazing what she did in so little time. My son cried after working with another instructor and was anxious about further lessons. With Missy's approach, my son learned so much better and gained confidence. As a result of only 2 private lessons, he passed his road test right before leaving for college. And we know how to help him be safer now.

  comment:  Missy has a real gift for working with kids- especially those with challenges. We needed an OT that was trained in Sensory Processing Disorder. As we found out, a lot of OTs claim to have that training, but Missy is the real deal. She gets it and she knows how to work with kids to teach them to compensate.
